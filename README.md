# desktop_screenshots
This is to collect images of personal desktop screenshots.
I am sure once we collect images, we will find some patterns and the information pulled from that will be really interesting!

Here is how. 
1. Screenshot your personal computer's desktop. If you have more than 1, grab all.
2. Please name the file with the city you live in (NewYork, Sydney, etc), age, gender(F/M/or if you don't want, you can skip it) and what your profession is(financeConsultant, engineer, etc).
   ex: NewYork_28_F_student_1.jpg, Qutar_39_M_architect.jpg
3. Upload all your screenshots.
4. Once we start to see some patterns, we can start analysing!
