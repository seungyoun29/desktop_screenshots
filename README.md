# desktop_screenshots
This is to collect images of personal desktop screenshots.

I am sure once we collect images, we will find some patterns and the information pulled from that will be really interesting!

Here is how. 

1. Screenshot your personal computer's desktop. If you have more than 1, grab all.

2. Please name the file with 

      Gender: F/M or if you don't want, you can skip it 
      
      Age
      
      Profession: storeManager, engineer, etc
      
      City you live in: NewYork, Sydney, Prague, etc
      
      Number of the photos you are uploading
      
      ex: F_24_student_NewYork_1/2.png, M_39_architect_Dubai_1/1.png

3. Upload all your screenshots.

Once we start to see some patterns, we can start analysing!
